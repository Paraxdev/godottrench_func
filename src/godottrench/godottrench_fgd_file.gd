## The addon's core entities, followed by the project's installed entity pack.
##
## The Gameplay entities pack is not part of the addon. Installing it copies its definitions and scripts into
## [member pack_fgd_path], where the project owns them. This file reads them from there, so every FGD that has it as a
## base, like the addon's defaults and the demo's, gets the pack without listing it. When two definitions share a
## classname the later one wins: the core, then the pack, then the entities of an FGD that has this one as its base.

## Where an installed entity pack keeps its FGD file. Nothing is added when there is no file there.
